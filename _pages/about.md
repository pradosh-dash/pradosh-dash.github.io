I am currently a Research Scientist Intern at Meta Reality Lab Research, where I develop next-generation soft wearable technologies and design high-performance acoustic-based sensors for AR/VR integration and applied robotics. Concurrently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, specializing in transcranial focused ultrasound therapy and neuromodulation using nonlinear acoustics.
As a researcher, I explore the intricacies of the human brain through the lens of acoustics, vibrations, and neuroscience. My work involves using precise experimental and numerical methods to investigate the dynamics of coupled skull-brain interfaces for applications in brain imaging and therapy. I focus on developing acoustic hologram-based ultrasound systems and fast parallelized models for enhanced skull aberration correction.
My professional background spans both industry and academia. I have 3+ years of experience as a Senior Design Engineer in automotive noise and vibration control at Bajaj Auto Ltd., where I optimized engine subsystems for enhanced performance. I earned my Master of Science degree from Virginia Tech, where I specialized in the vibro-acoustics of rolling tires to model structure-borne noise.
If my expertise aligns with your research interests, I welcome opportunities for collaboration and discussion.
