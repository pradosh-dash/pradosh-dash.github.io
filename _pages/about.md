I am currently a Research Scientist Intern at Meta Platform Inc. - Reality Lab Research, where I develop next-generation soft wearable technologies and design high-performance wearable acoustic-based sensors for AR/VR integration and applied robotics. I am also a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology under the supervision of Prof. Costas D. Arvanitis, specializing in transcranial focused ultrasound therapy and neuromodulation using nonlinear acoustics. My research focuses on developing fast parallelized acoustic propagation models for skull aberration correction and designing acoustic hologram-based ultrasound systems for enhanced precision in brain therapy.
Previously, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at Virginia Tech's Vibration and Acoustics Laboratory, where I developed vibroacoustic modeling techniques for tires under rolling conditions and designed semi-active tuned absorbers for Parkinson's disease tremor reduction. Prior to my graduate studies, I gained 3+ years of industry experience as a Senior Design Engineer at Bajaj Auto Ltd. in India, where I optimized engine subsystems for noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH), conducted psychoacoustic tuning of exhaust systems, and led cross-functional teams in automotive product development.
I earned my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Tech in 2020, focusing on operational modal analysis of rolling tires for structure-borne noise prediction, and my B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India, in 2015, where I graduated as the University Gold Medalist for academic excellence.
