I am a Research Scientist Intern at Meta Reality Labs Research and a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My work spans soft wearable technologies, acoustic sensing for AR/VR and robotics, and transcranial focused ultrasound for imaging and neuromodulation using nonlinear acoustics. Combining rigorous experimentation with high-fidelity simulations, I investigate skullâ€“brain dynamics and develop acoustic-hologram systems with fast, parallelized models for skull aberration correction. I earned an M.S. at Virginia Tech with a research focus on tire vibro-acoustics and structure-borne noise. Prior to graduate school, I spent over three years in the automotive industry as a Senior Design Engineer focused on engine design and noise and vibration engineering.
